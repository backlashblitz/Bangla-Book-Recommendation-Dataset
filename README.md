# Bangla_Book_Recommendation_Dataset

## Summary

This repository contains the dataset and code for the paper [Towards Personalized Bangla Book Recommendation: A Large-Scale Multi-Entity Book Graph Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12129). In this work, we introduce a large-scale multi-entity heterogeneous graph dataset for Bangla book recommendation, integrating users, books, authors, publishers, and categories. Our framework enables the development of sophisticated graph-based recommendation systems. This contribution aims to enhance the discovery of Bangla literature through more accurate and personalized user experiences.
